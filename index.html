                                        <p>I will start by saying that I love you, I love you madly, I love you with all my heart, my body, my mind and my soul. I am the luckiest person on this world because I met you, I have you in my life. You are the most caring, kind, loving, Beautiful, sexiest, faithful, educated, decent, romantic, beautiful inside and out, supportive, good listener, honest, trustworthy, the perfect one, the only one who knows everything about me. Each and every day I am grateful for another moment to spend getting to know who you really are mi amor; spending time with you and sharing dreams, secrets, and stories of our lives. With every moment my heart grows closer to you. The tenderness of your heart and the sweetness of your soul captivate me and leave me feeling so very lucky. Each and every day with you paints a new picture of tomorrow.  It’s our tomorrow and it’s filled with laughter, hope, joy and love mahal ko. Mahal na mahal kita Bianca at hanggang dulo kitang mamahalin pa!! This past few weeks, nag-aaway tayo, nagtatampuhan, we hurt each other or rather, nasasaktan kita sa sinasabi ko but thanks to God we're still here standing with the chin up. ♥  It shows that our love is growing up, is getting mature. It's not a "Puppy Love" anymore. I love you My mahal.
